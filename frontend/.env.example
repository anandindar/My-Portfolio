# Rename this file to .env and update the endpoint value before building locally
# The endpoint should accept POST requests with name, email, and message fields.
# For local development against the new Express backend use:
# VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/contact
VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT=https://your-backend-domain/api/contact
